# Normalnet

Project for PSYCH 250.

This project implements a deep convolution neural network predicting surface normals from images. 
The structure was from Paper ["Physically-Based Rendering for Indoor Scene Understanding Using Convolutional Neural Networks"](<http://robots.princeton.edu/projects/2016/PBRS/>).
The implementation here used tensorflow and the dataset used was a synthetic dataset generated by NeuroAILab in Stanford, of which the codes will be published publicly later.
The examples of the dataset were shown in Ipython-notebook in this repo.

## Structure

Detailed descriptions of the structure could be found in the [paper](<http://robots.princeton.edu/projects/2016/PBRS/>).
In short, the structure includes two modules, encoder and decoder.
The network is a fully convolutional network ([FCN](<https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jonlong/long_shelhamer_fcn.pdf>)) with skip-layers.
The encoder is applied first to the input image to get a low-resolution representation using convolution and pooling layers.
The decoder starts from the low-resolution representation and uses convolution and unpooling layers to get a high-resolution surface normal prediction. 

The structure of the encoder is the same as conv1 to conv5 of [VGG-16](<https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1556.pdf>) network
