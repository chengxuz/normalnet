# Normalnet

Project for PSYCH 250.

This project implements a deep convolution neural network predicting surface normals from images. 
The structure was from Paper "Physically-Based Rendering for Indoor Scene Understanding Using Convolutional Neural Networks"(<http://robots.princeton.edu/projects/2016/PBRS/>).
The implementation used tensorflow and the dataset used was a synthetic dataset generated by NeuroAILab in Stanford, of which the codes will be published publicly later.
The examples of the dataset were shown in Ipython-notebook in this repo.

## Structure

Detailed descriptions of the structure could be found in the paper (<http://robots.princeton.edu/projects/2016/PBRS/>).
